In 1899, the US mediated an arbitration court that ceded the Essequibo region to the United Kingdom to the detriment of Venezuela, but this judgment was annulled due to procedural problems. In 1966, when Guyana became independent, the countries tried the Geneva Agreement to end the conflict, but were unable to reach a consensus. In 2018, Guyana filed a request for the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to ratify the current borders, but there has been no judgment yet. In October 2023, the Venezuelan government publicly declared its intention to annex the Essequibo region and scheduled a popular referendum to consult the Venezuelan population and decide on the annexation of the territory.

Presume for the purposes of this debate that the Pevensies are aware that, should they depart Narnia, they may never return, and will return to their residence in their former child forms (but with memories intact) seconds after they left.","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"2023-08-12","Circuit":"Asia","Format":"BP","Country":"Philippines","International":"Online","Tournament":"Makiling Pre-ABP 2023","CA_1":"","CA_2":"","CA_3":"","CA_4":"","CA_5":"","CA_6":"","CA_7":"","CA_8":"","CA_9":"","Event_Link":"https://makdo.calicotab.com/makdo2023/participants/list/","Round_Code":"Novice_Z","Round":"Novice_Final","Motion":"THR the trend of \\"self centricity\\" ","Infoslide":"The trend of self-centricity refers to the growing emphasis on priortising one\'s needs, desires, and well-being in various aspects of life.","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"2023-08-12","Circuit":"Asia","Format":"BP","Country":"Philippines","International":"Online","Tournament":"Makiling Pre-ABP 2023","CA_1":"","CA_2":"","CA_3":"","CA_4":"","CA_5":"","CA_6":"","CA_7":"","CA_8":"","CA_9":"","Event_Link":"https://makdo.calicotab.com/makdo2023/participants/list/","Round_Code":"5","Round":"5","Motion":"THS the \\"Russia Interference\\" law","Infoslide":"The \\"Russian Interference\\" law is a new law being passed in Poland as a way to respond against the potential of Russian influence being present in the country.

Based on this experience, they have teamed up extensively with a different set of teammates which has been successful. II) For the purposes of this debate, this is likely to be the last year majors are going to be online, post which it is uncertain whether they will be able to access these tournaments. X & Y have spent time preparing for majors with their current teammates. However, in the run up to majors, they realize their current teammates won�t be able to make it to the competition. This leaves them with the choice of either debating with each other or settling for an untested partner.

The disaster also prompted the evacuation of over 150,000 people from the area surrounding the power plant, creating a large exclusion zone. The cleanup and decommissioning process is estimated to take several decades to complete. Since then, the government has reduced the role of nuclear power. In early 2023, Japan\'s Cabinet approved plans to extend the lifespans of nuclear reactors beyond 60 years and build new units to replace those that are decommissioned, reversing policies put in place after the Fukushima disaster in 2011.","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"2023-03-20","Circuit":"Asia","Format":"WSDC","Country":"Japan","International":"","Tournament":"Japan Debate Open 2023","CA_1":"","CA_2":"","CA_3":"","CA_4":"","CA_5":"","CA_6":"","CA_7":"","CA_8":"","CA_9":"","Event_Link":"https://edudrift.calicotab.com/jdo2023/","Round_Code":"2","Round":"2","Motion":"THS Anonymous in its retaliation against injustice when the state seems unwilling or unable to do so","Infoslide":"Hacktivism refers to the use of computer hacking skills, cyber techniques, and digital tools to promote, advance, or protest a social, political, or environmental issue.

Even fans that are minorly engaged and do not hold leadership roles spend a significant portion of their time and energy on fandom activities. For example, K-pop fandoms are spread over multiple social media platforms, and users engage in activities such as photo-sharing, organized voting, translation of content into other languages, and bulk purchasing of merchandise. K-pop artists largely depend on engagement with fans (selling merchandise, tickets, etc.) for success.

Scientists believe that once the impact occurs, it will lead to human extinction. After repeated studies and debates, people are finally forced to choose between two scenarios. Option A would launch all the nuclear fuel available to mankind to a specific location on the surface of the asteroid and detonate it, generating a counter-thrust by vaporizing the asteroid\'s surface material in order to change its orbit. There would not be enough time to change the orbit, and the explosion would likely create more debris instead. Option A has a very low chance of success, but offers the possibility of survival to all equally. Plan B, on the other hand, would select the best astronauts, carry well-preserved plant seeds, fertilized animal eggs, and a database of human civilization, and escape in several nuclear-powered spacecraft to a known habitable planet to rebuild human civilization. Based on existing spaceflight experience, Plan B is likely to succeed. Due to the limited amount of nuclear fuel available, the two options cannot be executed at the same time.","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"2022-02-26","Circuit":"North America and Canada","Format":"BP","Country":"Canada","International":"Online","Tournament":"Western Spring High School Tournament 2022","CA_1":"Adam Ursenbach","CA_2":"Daniel Svirsky","CA_3":"Grace Zhu","CA_4":"Jeffrey Cheung","CA_5":"Cecilia Cai","CA_6":"George Macauley","CA_7":"","CA_8":"","CA_9":"","Event_Link":"https://westernhst22.calicotab.com/westernhst22/","Round_Code":"Junior_Y","Round":"Junior_Semi","Motion":"THP a world in which prediction markets are in widespread use","Infoslide":"Prediction markets are markets created to bet on the outcome of future events.

An IPO allows a company to raise capital from public investors. The transition from a private to a public company can be an important time for private investors to fully realize gains from their investment as it typically includes a share premium for current private investors. Meanwhile, it also allows public investors to participate in the offering. The key characteristic that differentiates most of these tech firms from other firms launching their IPOs is that they are loss making firms. For instance, Zomato, Paytm, and PB Fin-tech reported the loss of Rs. 356 crores, Rs. 381 crores, Rs. 110 crores respectively for the quarter ended June 2021. MobiKwik witnessed an 11% increase in its loss levels to Rs. 111 crores for the FY 2021. However, despite being loss making firms, retail investors are eagerly look forward to bidding and participating in these IPOs. Experts suggest that loss making companies such as Paytm use IPO routes to give early venture capital investors a profitable exit while roping in public investors who buy into the \\"Digital India\\" big picture. While some also suggest that requiring a standard of financial viability for IPO seeking companies will instil some form of financial discipline in these companies. The fact that most of the loss making IPO seeking companies are tech companies does raise larger concerns.","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"2022-01-14","Circuit":"Asia","Format":"AP","Country":"India","International":"Online","Tournament":"College of Business Studies Parliamentary Debates 2022","CA_1":"Ajatshatru Rawat","CA_2":"Archit Dikshit","CA_3":"Kareema Barry","CA_4":"Nikita Bhatia","CA_5":"Taufique Shoogufan","CA_6":"","CA_7":"","CA_8":"","CA_9":"","Event_Link":"https://cbspd.herokuapp.com/cbsvi/","Round_Code":"2","Round":"2","Motion":"THBT labour unions should not demand shareholder positions for their members","Infoslide":"Shareholders have the right to vote at shareholder meetings and are entitled to a portion of the success of a company.

The EU has accused Belarus of �weaponizing refugees� and Russia of masterminding the situation. The EU\'s response to date has been to support Poland and impose a new list of sanctions targeting all individuals and entities that it believes are helping the Lukashenko administration move people towards the border.","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"2021-12-03","Circuit":"Asia","Format":"BP","Country":"China","International":"Online","Tournament":"SUFE China BP","CA_1":"Benjamin Goh","CA_2":"Clarice Tee","CA_3":"Daniel Wiyarta Tenggara","CA_4":"Josh Kemp","CA_5":"Loke Wing Fatt","CA_6":"","CA_7":"","CA_8":"","CA_9":"","Event_Link":"https://cbp2021.calicotab.com/chinabp2021/participants/list/","Round_Code":"Open_X","Round":"Open_Quarter","Motion":"THS implementing \\"Clean slate\\" legislation","Infoslide":"\\"Clean slate\\" is a type of legislation that automatically seals the criminal records of someone who has not reoffended for a certain number of years after they have been released from prison.

While Kashmiri remains the primary language of communication within families and society, it�s eroding within the educational and public sector. However, it is heartening to observe that many Kashmiri women are writing in the language. A Srinagar-based telecom engineer, Rumuz writes under a pen-name. Of late, she has been writing poetry in both Kashmiri and English which has been published in online magazines like KashmirLit, Kashmir Reader, University of Kashmir Journals, and Sheeraza\'s special edition on Contemporary Poets of Kashmir. Rumuz describes her writing as an attempt in ��redefining the relationship of man �particularly a woman with God, conflict/resistance in Kashmir not just from a gendered perspective but also whilst raising the questions around broader contours of human existence and our ideas of love, life, relationships and death�. Rumuz believes that with time women must start writing differently about conflict locating it in a larger context than gender. She says that with time the manifestations of patriarchy and misogyny had also changed and thus, it is important to now instead talk about universal conflict, freedom, empowerment, self-reliance, power structures, societal normalization of discrimination and of course, resistance. Women poets are contributing to the literary landscape of Kashmir and Rumuz is of the view that this �diversity is beauty and respecting diversity is justice.��Voices of new women poets reinforces this system of justice within which cannot call any literary landscape vibrant, fair and just unless it removes the barriers of gender, caste, creed and social standing. Contrastingly, a landay is an oral and often anonymous scrap of song created by and for mostly illiterate women and are mostly sung, however - singing is linked to licentiousness in the Afghan consciousness, where the act of such landays are punishable by death. Many of these landays use sex and war to tease men about their cowardice in bed and in battle. This is one of the ways in which Pashtun women undermine the social code through these folk poems: simultaneously seducing men and mocking their weakness at the very skills with which they�re supposed to display the greatest strength.","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"2020-07-02","Circuit":"Asia","Format":"AP","Country":"India","International":"Online","Tournament":"ILS PD 2020","CA_1":"Himanshu Patil","CA_2":"Vedika Walia","CA_3":"Bharath G","CA_4":"Mehar Jauhar","CA_5":"Vijeeth Srinivas","CA_6":"","CA_7":"","CA_8":"","CA_9":"","Event_Link":"https://ilspd2020.herokuapp.com/ilspd2020","Round_Code":"Novice_Y","Round":"Novice_Semi","Motion":"TH as the LGBT+ Community regrets Bohemian Rhapsody","Infoslide":"Bohemian Rhapsody is a biopic film about Freddy Mercury, depicting his life and struggles as a member of the LGBT+ community suffering from AIDS in the HIV epidemic of the 80�s and 90�.

More than 1,400 civilians were killed that day. Thousands of dying patients flooded into makeshift hospitals�one of them underground, known to locals simply as �the Cave.� In the dark tunnels of that subterranean hospital, a 29-year-old paediatrician worked tirelessly to save children�s lives. Her name is Dr. Amani Ballour, and she would risk her life to work in the Cave for five years. In 2018, she was forcibly evacuated to T�rkiye. Three months later, at an international humanitarian conference, she would be called to give official testimony as a witness to the war crimes committed by the Assad regime in Eastern Ghouta. Dr. Ballour and her medical staff are the subjects of Feras Fayyad�s Oscar-nominated documentary The Cave, a harrowing account of one of the last bastions of emergency services in war-torn Ghouta. \\"When I was young, no one tried to tell me that I had rights, that I can be something important. All the people around me said, \'You\'ll get married and have children,\'\\" Ballour said in an interview by phone. \\"I wanted strongly to change this image, to tell young girls that you have rights, that you can be very important, that you are no different than the boys.\\" It would be hard to fathom a more sorrowful place than the hospital of \\"The Cave.\\" But it would be equally difficult to imagine a more inspiring figure than Ballour. \\"I wanted to bring all of the struggle against the sadness, the depression, the death, the daily attacks on the hospital, where we can see the most courageous people and a woman who is fighting to make a space for hope,\\" says Fayyad. \\"We own the narrative here, completely, proudly.\\" However, in Fayyad�s follow-up short documentary, First Eyewitness, Dr. Ballour struggles to adjust to life in T�rkiye while establishing her new role as an advocate for Syria on the international stage. She hopes to return to practicing medicine someday, but for now she is haunted by her years in the Cave, where she treated many children with severe head injuries, including one child who was suffering so much, his mother asked Dr. Ballour to put him out of his misery. �All medical work has become suffering,� Dr. Ballour says in the film. �I can�t work like I used to.

The village�s cockle harvest has traditionally been the province of women, and it�s time for Dulce to contribute. Besides, her mother says, what will happen to Dulce when the ever-rising seawater drowns the village? The short documentary �Dulce�, directed by Guille Isa and Angello Faccini, is a coming-of-age story told against the backdrop of climate change. Mangroves around the world serve as a carbon sink, and in places like coastal Colombia, they also help to mitigate the effects of rising sea levels by acting as a bulwark. When the documentary crew initially travelled to Iscuand�, they were on assignment by Conservation International to cover the threats to some 35,000 acres of mangrove forests in the area, which are being destroyed by development and unregulated logging. �No one had any idea we�d stumble on individuals as compelling as Dulce and Betty,� Darrell Hartman, one of the film�s producers, told me. �The first time we saw Dulce, she was standing on the dock looking at us as we got closer in a boat,� Isa told me. �I thought to myself: Who is this girl? She had this presence�this deep look. We were immediately drawn to her and knew she [would become] our character.� Isa and Faccini filmed Dulce as Betty taught her how to swim over the course of three emotional days. Faccini set up his camera a measured distance away from his subjects, enabling him to capture the kind of steady, composed shots that are atypical of documentaries. �We were extremely careful about how we approached the scenes,� Faccini told me. �We tried to be as invisible as possible and let the performances find their own rhythm.�","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"2020-07-02","Circuit":"Asia","Format":"AP","Country":"India","International":"Online","Tournament":"ILS PD 2020","CA_1":"Himanshu Patil","CA_2":"Vedika Walia","CA_3":"Bharath G","CA_4":"Mehar Jauhar","CA_5":"Vijeeth Srinivas","CA_6":"","CA_7":"","CA_8":"","CA_9":"","Event_Link":"https://ilspd2020.herokuapp.com/ilspd2020","Round_Code":"3","Round":"3","Motion":"THS the characterisation of nudges as intervention","Infoslide":"Nudge is a concept in behavioral science, political theory and behavioral economics which proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals.

Estonia offers 18 months of paid parental leave. Poland dishes out 500 zloty (about �120) per month for each child after the first, meaning a parent with three would reap the equivalent of nearly half the minimum wage. In Hungary mothers of four are exempt from income taxes for life, and the government is considering extending the benefit to mothers of three. Having more babies is one area where eastern and western Europe can agree.

The minister who oversaw that transformation was Ursula von der Leyen, now president of the European Commission (and a mother of seven, as her Twitter page proudly notes).","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"2020-07-02","Circuit":"Asia","Format":"AP","Country":"India","International":"Online","Tournament":"ILS PD 2020","CA_1":"Himanshu Patil","CA_2":"Vedika Walia","CA_3":"Bharath G","CA_4":"Mehar Jauhar","CA_5":"Vijeeth Srinivas","CA_6":"","CA_7":"","CA_8":"","CA_9":"","Event_Link":"https://ilspd2020.herokuapp.com/ilspd2020","Round_Code":"2","Round":"2","Motion":"THBT the VBA should form an alliance with the Indian National Congress","Infoslide":"The Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) is a newly formed political party by Prakash Ambedkar.

The Congress ministries under Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru issued an ultimatum to the Viceroy, �Promise India�s independence after the war and the Congress will wholeheartedly support the war effort�. The Viceroy refused, and the ministries resigned on the instigation of Nehru in October 1939. This decision was heavily criticized by top ranking leaders within the Congress like Azad, Vallabhai Patel, and K.M. Munshi. This internal opposition believed that the Congress would be taken as a serious political player only if it remained within the government. By resigning, the Congress had created a situation where Whitehall would no longer need to appease the Congress. As a result of Nehru�s decision, the Muslim League was able to gain much needed political clout, by supporting the British war effort (as the only voice of the Indian Muslims). The British in return promised to consult the League on all matters relating to the potential transfer of power. This essentially conferred a veto on the League that would eventually assist in being one of the contributing factors to the Partition of the country.","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"2020-07-02","Circuit":"Asia","Format":"AP","Country":"India","International":"Online","Tournament":"ILS PD 2020","CA_1":"Himanshu Patil","CA_2":"Vedika Walia","CA_3":"Bharath G","CA_4":"Mehar Jauhar","CA_5":"Vijeeth Srinivas","CA_6":"","CA_7":"","CA_8":"","CA_9":"","Event_Link":"https://ilspd2020.herokuapp.com/ilspd2020","Round_Code":"1","Round":"1","Motion":"THBT surrealist art is the pinnacle of artistic expression","Infoslide":"Surrealism is a 20th-century avant-garde movement in art and literature which sought to release the creative potential of the unconscious mind, for example by the irrational juxtaposition of images.

Process, the rate at which adults age is directly tied to the difference between their Carbon Footprint and the Carbon Footprint Benchmark. - The Carbon Footprint Benchmark is the level of Carbon Footprint on a per capita basis that would maintain the current status of the climate. - The Carbon Footprint Benchmark changes over time to account for the state of the climate. o For example, in 2024 the Carbon Footprint Benchmark may be X units; however, if by 2034, the health of the climate has improved, the Carbon Footprint Benchmark would increase, e.g. to X+2 units � i.e. individuals would be able to generate a higher Carbon Footprint before they reached the Carbon Footprint Benchmark. - An individual�s Carbon Footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, emitted directly or indirectly by an individual; factors such as an individual�s energy usage, travel habits, dietary choices, and consumption patterns are taken into account. - Individuals with Carbon Footprints above the Carbon Footprint Benchmark age faster than natural, while those with Carbon Footprints lower than the Carbon Footprint Benchmark age slower than natural. - The rate at which you age is linear not exponential (i.e. every Carbon Footprint unit above or below the Carbon Footprint Benchmark has the same impact on ageing as the previous unit). - For example, consider two individuals, Abhi and Charlie, who are the same age but have different Carbon Footprints. o Abhi, who lives a sustainable lifestyle with minimal carbon emissions, may age at a rate equivalent to one year for every 18 months that pass. o In contrast, Charlie, whose lifestyle is characterised by high carbon emissions from excessive consumption and travel, may age at a rate of one year for every nine months that pass. - An individual�s Carbon Footprint is discounted by the degree of choice they had over the relevant act. o For example, consider two other individuals, Bob and Anna, if Bob invites Anna for lunch and makes steak, and they both eat the same amount of it, Bob�s Carbon Footprint would be higher than Anna if he had decided, without Anna�s input, to serve steak rather than a more environmentally friendly option. - The Shani Ageing Process does not affect one�s ability to die for causes not related to ageing. - In a world with the Shani Ageing Process, people�s understanding of it would mirror their understanding of the natural ageing process in the current world.","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"","Circuit":"Europe and IONA","Format":"BP","Country":"United

In 2020, parts of the BLM movement began campaigning for the defunding of police. If successful, defunding the police would mean that law enforcement budgets would be dramatically cut, with fewer police officers. Ideally, these budgets would be reallocated into public institutions. Other parts of the BLM movement believe that the police should be abolished altogether. If successful, abolishing the police would mean that current law enforcement systems would be replaced entirely by alternatives to policing. These alternatives to policing may include a greater focus upon preventative measures, through public health initiatives and community-based organisations, and different approaches to conflict management, through, for example, community patrols or �peace officers�, specialist crisis response teams or community mediation. The BLM campaign for defunding the police has had moderate success, with a number of American cities decreasing funding to law enforcement agencies, such as in New York, Los Angeles and Minneapolis.","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"","Circuit":"Asia","Format":"WSDC","Country":"","International":"","Tournament":"Asia Schools Open Summer 2021","CA_1":"Jasmine Ho","CA_2":"Madeleine Bosler","CA_3":"","CA_4":"","CA_5":"","CA_6":"","CA_7":"","CA_8":"","CA_9":"","Event_Link":"https://edudrift.calicotab.com/asosummer2021/","Round_Code":"5","Round":"5","Motion":"THP a world without the expectation to go to university","Infoslide":"The expectation to go to university refers to the pressure placed on children to attend tertiary institutions before entering the workforce.

A megacity is characterized by having a big population that continues to quickly grow due to urbanization from other regions, with relatively noticeable pockets of poverty due to wealth gap. Le Corbusier\'s concept of urban planning envisions polished infrastructures (wide roads, clear sidewalks, spacious public facilities, etc.) within cities with well-defined sectors (e.g. clear separation of residential and commercial areas, etc.) This concept desires a city that looks good in an aerial view. Examples for this concept is the recent form of Thamrin/Sudirman in Jakarta, downtown Singapore, etc. The informally-called \\"chaotic warm\\" approach is the opposite: a city that looks �messy� from up above but feels \\"warm\\" to its inhabitants: for example, the experience of urban villages, city alleyways scattered with street food hawkers and hole-in-the-wall establishments. Examples to this would be Brooklyn in NYC, Hong Kong�s art district, Kota Tua, etc. For the purpose of this debate, both approaches would also aim for cleanliness, relative order, and security, albeit in different ways of delivering/implementing them.","Topic_Area_1":"","Topic_Area_2":"","Topic_Area_3":"","Topic_Area_Specific_1":""},{"Date":"","Circuit":"Asia","Format":"Australs","Country":"Indonesia","International":"Online","Tournament":"Au-Strals","CA_1":"Uphie Abdurrahman","CA_2":"Judah Purwanto","CA_3":"Tengku Omar","CA_4":"","CA_5":"","CA_6":"","CA_7":"","CA_8":"","CA_9":"","Event_Link":"https://aurgumentum.herokuapp.com/au-strals2021/","Round_Code":"1","Round":"1","Motion":"As a fresh college graduate.
